       <h2>About us</h2>
       <p>
       
       Drishti is dedicated to promoting inclusivity and equality for transgender children. Our mission is to create safe spaces, provide resources, and advocate for their rights. We believe that every children deserves a supportive and accepting environment to thrive in. With a passionate team and strong partnerships, we strive to make a positive impact in the lives of transgender children. 
       For us, gender is beyond the binary of man and woman. We recognize gender as a structure with different norms for people assigned female and people assigned male at birth. We consciously challenge the binary framework through our work, vision, and agenda. We ensure that this understanding of gender permeates perspectives of organizations working on gender in different capacities. Our understanding of sexuality also moves beyond violence and identities. Sexuality is a lens to help analyse structures and institutions by which we can address issues of marginalization and inclusivity in a holistic manner.
       Trans* is an umbrella term for transgender people, gender queer people or people who do not confirm to notions of gender assigned to them at birth. </p>

      <section id="v">
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p> Our vision for the transgender children  is a space where students, staff, faculty and community members from all sexes, gender identities, gender expressions and orientations* are welcomed and celebrated.  We envision a space where the diverse transgender community can find healing, connection, self-exploration and education. </p>
        <p>We envision a space that is filled with the sounds of joy, laughter, and conversation.  A community that sees critical dialogue and feedback as an opportunity for positive change and growth.</p>
    </section>
